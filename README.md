Formula 1 (F1) racing is one of the most entertaining and prestigious motorsport events and has fascinated audiences around the world for over seventy years.
We introduce our new machine learning technique “F1 Predictor” to extract useful insights from a wide range of historical data. The system has been carefully designed to predict the winner of any Formula 1 race using a comprehensive analysis of six simple data frames from the start of the season in 1950 to the present day. 
This clear and detailed data dump contains lots of useful information, including race statistics, driver rankings, team rankings, qualifying performances and even cloud wind details.
The main aim of this project is to develop a machine learning protocol to predict the winner of Formula 1 races. 
The ultimate goal is to create a robust predictive model and performance metrics, including accuracy scores and likelihood ratios, to demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of F1 Predictor in the development of Formula 1 race results and predictions.

The algoritms used Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, SVC, K Neighbors Classifier, GaussianNB, confusion matrix, precision score, f1 score, recall score.
You can add any html code to create a frontend for this model with ease and the related information is already in in ipynb file.
